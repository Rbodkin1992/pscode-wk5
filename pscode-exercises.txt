// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(My pseudocode here)
*** 
    // Prompt the user to enter a number
    PRINT "Enter a number: "
    READ number

    // Check if the number is even or odd
    IF number MOD 2 == 0 THEN
        PRINT "The number ", number, " is even."
    ELSE
        PRINT "The number ", number, " is odd."
    END IF


In this pseudo code:
- `number MOD 2 == 0` checks if the remainder of `number` divided by 2 is 0, which means the number is even.
- If the condition is true, it prints that the number is even.
- Otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
*** START

// Step A: Read five separate numbers
DECLARE num1, num2, num3, num4, num5 AS INTEGER

PRINT "Enter five numbers: "
READ num1
READ num2
READ num3
READ num4
READ num5

// Step B: Calculate the average of the five numbers
DECLARE average AS FLOAT
average = (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5) / 5

// Step C: Find the smallest and the largest of the five numbers
DECLARE smallest, largest AS INTEGER

// Initialize smallest and largest
smallest = num1
largest = num1

// Compare each number to find the smallest
IF num2 < smallest THEN
    smallest = num2
ENDIF

IF num3 < smallest THEN
    smallest = num3
ENDIF

IF num4 < smallest THEN
    smallest = num4
ENDIF

IF num5 < smallest THEN
    smallest = num5
ENDIF

// Compare each number to find the largest
IF num2 > largest THEN
    largest = num2
ENDIF

IF num3 > largest THEN
    largest = num3
ENDIF

IF num4 > largest THEN
    largest = num4
ENDIF

IF num5 > largest THEN
    largest = num5
ENDIF

// Output the results
PRINT "The average of the five numbers is: ", average
PRINT "The smallest number is: ", smallest
PRINT "The largest number is: ", largest

-- END --
